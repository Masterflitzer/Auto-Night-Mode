# Auto Night Mode

This script toggles the Windows 10 dark or light mode if it is executed without arguments.

When executed with the 'auto' argument, it acts as an automatic night mode. This means that the dark or light mode is activated within a certain period of time.

This period can be defined at the beginning of the script code (between the marked comments). 

With the Windows Task Scheduler, this script can be run automatically every 15 minutes, for example.
